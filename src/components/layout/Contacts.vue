        <p>Our headquarters are based in a hot air balloon, and as such we are, just like our philosophy wants, at the mercy of the winds. You will therefore have a bit of trouble catching us, and we have a bit of trouble letting you know in advance where exactly we will be in any given moment. Right now we are floating peacefully somewhere in the skies over Costa Rica, but we have reason to believe things will soon change.</p>

        <p>We don't have a telephone, since they don't make ones with a long enough wire, and my personal mobile, which was until recently the one we used as customer service, was unfortunately dropped somewhere into the Pacific Ocean. We have, however, trained most pigeons to bring messages to us, so for any question you might have if you will be kind enough to just grab a random pigeon and entrusting your message for us to it, we will get back to you as fast as said pigeon can fly.</p>
